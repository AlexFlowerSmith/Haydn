STEP 1: https://www.python.org/     < hover over DONWLOAD and it'll actually select the right OS when you click the Python 3.x.x version button\
STEP 2: ADD PYTHON 3.0 TO PATH      < this MUST be selected bottom of the first window that pops up when you run the downloaded executable for Python \
STEP 3: MAKE SURE 'PIP' IS TICKED   < Pip is a python package manager, so it will handle missing packages if needed
STEP 4: "ALL USERS" can be turned off\
STEP $: "IDLE" make sure is ticked  < This is the Python program to let you write your own code. It might have something to do with running other code? Idk \

STEP 5: Right click on your downloaded python file and click run in CMD or something whatever seems obvious
